# Contributing to GenCr@ft Studio

Thank you for considering contributing! This document provides a high-level overview of the contribution workflow for all repositories within the **GenCr@ft Studio** GitHub organization.

## How to Contribute

Our development process follows a standardized Git workflow. All changes, whether code, documentation, or assets, must be proposed via a Pull Request (PR).

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

Every significant change must be associated with a GitHub Issue for traceability.

### 2. Create Your Branch

Branches must follow the naming convention: **`type/short-description`**.

- **`type`**: `feature`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.

### 3. Commit Your Changes

All commit messages **MUST** follow the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This is enforced by our tooling.

### 4. Create a Pull Request

Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch and fill out the provided template. Ensure you link the issue your PR resolves.
