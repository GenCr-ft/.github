# Decision Record: [Concise Title of the Decision] (`DECISION-XXX`)

* **Decision ID:** `DECISION-XXX` (Assign unique ID, e.g., DECISION-001)
* **Title:** [Concise Title of the Decision, e.g., API Stability Strategy]
* **Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by DECISION-YYY]
* **Date Proposed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
* **Date Decided:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
* **Owner / Driver:** [Name or Role leading the decision]
* **Stakeholders Notified:** [List of key roles/teams informed, e.g., Tech Leads, Product, Design]

## 1. Question / Problem Statement

* [Clearly and concisely state the specific question being answered or the problem being solved by this decision. Frame it as a question if possible. e.g., "How will we ensure API stability for modders post-MVP?"]

---

## 2. Context

* [Provide necessary background information. What led to this decision being needed? What are the relevant constraints (technical, business, time)? What are the key assumptions? Link to related requirements (Epics, Features, NFRs), research documents ([GRA], [EMS]), or issues.]
* *Constraint:* [e.g., Must be implemented by MVP+1 release]
* *Assumption:* [e.g., Modding community values stability highly based on [GRA]]
* *Related Requirement:* [`EPIC-PLUGIN-ECOSYSTEM`]

## 3. Alternatives Considered

* *[Detail the different options explored. Aim for 3-5 distinct alternatives where feasible.]*

### Alternative 1: [Brief Name/Description, e.g., "Strict SemVer Enforcement"]
* **Description:** [Briefly explain this option.]
* **Pros:**
    * [Advantage 1, e.g., Provides maximum predictability for modders.]
    * [Advantage 2, e.g., Industry standard, well understood.]
* **Cons:**
    * [Disadvantage 1, e.g., Can slow down internal development if breaking changes are needed frequently.]
    * [Disadvantage 2, e.g., Requires disciplined versioning across all API surfaces.]

### Alternative 2: [Brief Name/Description, e.g., "LTS Branches + SemVer"]
* **Description:** [Briefly explain this option.]
* **Pros:**
    * [Advantage 1, e.g., Offers stable branches for modders while allowing faster iteration on main development branch.]
* **Cons:**
    * [Disadvantage 1, e.g., Increases maintenance overhead (backporting fixes).]
    * [Disadvantage 2, e.g., Can lead to fragmentation if not managed carefully.]

### Alternative 3: [Brief Name/Description, e.g., "Best Effort Stability + Strong Communication"]
* **Description:** [Briefly explain this option.]
* **Pros:**
    * [Advantage 1, e.g., Maximum flexibility for internal development.]
* **Cons:**
    * [Disadvantage 1, e.g., Places significant burden on modders to adapt frequently.]
    * [Disadvantage 2, e.g., High risk of frustrating the modding community ([GRA] 48, 461]).]

### Alternative 4: [Brief Name/Description, e.g., "No Public API / Limited Access"]
* **Description:** [Briefly explain this option.]
* **Pros:**
    * [Advantage 1, e.g., Simplest approach technically, lowest initial dev cost.]
* **Cons:**
    * [Disadvantage 1, e.g., Fails to deliver on core product vision pillar (Extensibility).]
    * [Disadvantage 2, e.g., Fails to meet needs of P-MOD persona.]
    * [Disadvantage 3, e.g., Severely limits long-term content potential.]

*(Add Alternative 5 if applicable)*

## 4. Recommendation

* **Recommended Alternative:** [State the chosen alternative, e.g., Alternative 1: Strict SemVer Enforcement]
* **Reasoning:** [Explain *why* this alternative is recommended over the others. Reference specific Pros/Cons, alignment with Guiding Principles (from Vision Brief), Persona needs, NFRs, or strategic goals. e.g., "Alternative 1 is recommended because providing maximum stability aligns directly with the core need of the P-MOD persona and our strategic goal of fostering a thriving UGC ecosystem, despite the potential impact on internal iteration speed. The long-term benefits of creator trust outweigh the short-term flexibility concerns."]

---

## 5. Decision / Conclusion

* **Decision:** [Clearly and unambiguously state the final decision made. e.g., "We will adopt strict Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for the public Modding API (`SBX-API`) starting from its v1.0 release, coupled with a proactive communication strategy regarding planned changes and deprecations."]

---

## 6. Rationale (Summary)

* [Briefly summarize the core justification for the final decision, reinforcing the key factors.]
